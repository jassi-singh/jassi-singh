## Short Introduction

Backend-focused software engineer working primarily with **Go** and TypeScript on distributed systems and performance-sensitive services.
Enjoys building correctness-first backends, experimenting with trade-offs in real-world systems, and iterating through small, focused projects.

## Core Technical Skills

### Languages
- Go.
- TypeScript, JavaScript.
- Dart (small tools and UI experiments).

### Backend & Systems
- Backend services and internal tools in Go (APIs, workers, experimental services like Forge and Mini-Gatekeeper).
- Concurrency patterns, request coordination, and system behavior under load.
- Systems and performance experiments (tradeoff, aether-kv, simulators).

### Databases & Caching
- Key–value stores and custom storage abstractions (aether-kv).
- Caching and cache stampede mitigation through gatekeeping and controlled access.

### Cloud & Tooling
- Git-centric workflows and GitHub Actions-oriented development.
- Container- and service-friendly project structures for backend deployment.

## Featured Projects

### Forge
Distributed Key Generation service in Go focused on correctness, coordination, and performance under concurrent load.
Repository: [./forge](https://github.com/jassi-singh/forge)

### Mini-Gatekeeper
Go-based gatekeeper that mitigates cache stampede by controlling concurrent access to expensive operations.
Repository: [./mini-gatekeeper](https://github.com/jassi-singh/mini-gatekeeper)

### Aether KV
Key–value store experiment in Go exploring data layout, memory usage, and latency trade-offs.
Repository: [./aether-kv](https://github.com/jassi-singh/aether-kv)

### Flight Simulator
TypeScript project used as a sandbox for simulating system behavior and interactions.
Repository: [./flight-simulator](https://github.com/jassi-singh/flight-simulator)

## Engineering Interests

- Distributed systems and coordination.
- Concurrency, contention, and locking strategies.
- Reliability, failure handling, and system design.
- Caching, backpressure, and load-shedding.
- Observability and understanding real system behavior over time.
